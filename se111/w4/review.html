            <p><b>Zayd Alsasa</b> <i>February 4th 2021</i></p>
            <p><em>Monsters Inc.</em> is probably my favorite movie in my opinion because it has a lot of elements I enjoy in media. The movie has jokes, good animation(for it's time), a story line, and a good soundtrack. I saw this movie for the first time when I rented a VHS from the library.</p>
            <p>Mike Wazowski is probably one of my favorite animated characters. His personality and funny remarks give his character a lot of progression within the story.</p>
